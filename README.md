# Project Title: Initial Analysis of NHS Data using Python

# Project Description:
A brief foray into data analysis and visualisation, via Python, making use of pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. Done primarily as an assignment activity for the London School of Economics and Political Science's (LSE's) Data Analysis Career Accelerator. The key results of this exploration of NHS data indicate that there is significant underutilisation of the NHS's resources, and that this should be addressed by either hiring more staff (less preferable cost wise) or improving systematic efficiency of the NHS's current resources (more preferable).

# File descriptions:
- Chen_Christian_DA201_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook file containing all elements of the analysis.
- Chen_Christian_DA201_Assignment_Report.pdf: A report detailing the main findings of the analysis, as well as resultant recommendations.
- Chen_Christian_DA201_Assignment_Presentation.mp4: N/A (This file was originally meant to be included, but it exceeds the file size limit for GitHub)

# Version control:
- 22/05/2023: Uploaded initial commits of all main files (v1.0).
